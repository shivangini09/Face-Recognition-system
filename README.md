# Face_Recognition
## CSVS
- hog_95:contains concatenated features with only pca of 0.95 applied on hog features
- hog_99:contains concatenated features with only pca of 0.99 applied on hog features

## Demo_Code.ipynb
- This file contains the demo code of the project
- It contains the ensemble of classifiers and the another feature that helps in capturing similarities between any two given images

## Decision Tree:
- It contains the models trained on min images 50 and 70

## Ensemble Learning:
- It has the Ensemble_Learning.ipynb file that has the Random Forest trained on min images 50, 70 and Random Landscape on 50 images criteria
- The Random Landscape is a different class
- All the images as outcome of training above two models are contained in here

## Joblib_files:
- They have the trained models saved.
- We use these trained models in the demo code to deploy an ensemble of all the models trained by the team.

## Ensemble_Learning_Rough.ipynb
- This contains the pre training model that contains model trained on all 10,000 records

## SVM Classifier
- It contains all the data and files related to SVM

## standarscaler.joblib
- This is the file where we are storing the mean and standard deviation of the train data

## report.tex and report.pdf
- They are the project reports
